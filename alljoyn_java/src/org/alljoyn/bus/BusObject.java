package org.alljoyn.bus;

/**
 * Implemented by classes that are AllJoyn bus objects.
 * AllJoyn bus objects are registered with a {@link BusAttachment}. Once registered
 * they become visible to external bus connections and can then respond to
 * method calls and emit signals.
 *
 * Since BusObjects respond to method calls, they are listener objects.
 * Listener objects are the Java objects that handle Alljoyn events and are
 * called from AllJoyn in the context of one of its threads.  All listener
 * objects are expected to be multithread safe (MT-Safe) between construction
 * and destruction.  That is, every thread executing in a listener object's
 * methods 1) gets a unique copy of all temporary data (it is re-entrant); and
 * 2) all shared data -- the object instance's member variables or any globals
 * must contain no read-modify-write access patterns (okay to write or read,
 * just never to read-modify-write).  If such access patterns are required, it
 * is the responsibility of the client to, for example, add the synchronized
 * keyword when overriding one of the listener methods or provide some other
 * serialization mechanism in order to preserve MT-Safe operation.
 *
 * This rule extends to other objects accessed during processing of
 * notifications.  For example, it is a programming error to allow a notifiation
 * method to update a collection in another object without serializing access
 * to the collection.
 *
 * The important consideration in this case is that as soon as one sets up a
 * listener object to receive notifications from AllJoyn, one is implicitly
 * dealing with multithreaded code.
 *
 * Since listener objects generally run in the context of the AllJoyn thread
 * which manages reception of events, If a blocking AllJoyn call is made in
 * the context of a notification, the necessary and sufficient conditions for
 * deadlock are established.
 *
 * The important consideration in this case is that when one receives a
 * notification from AllJoyn, that notification is executing in the context of
 * an AllJoyn thread.  If one makes a blocking call back into AllJoyn on that
 * thread, a deadlock cycle is likely, and if this happens your bus attachment
 * receive thread will deadlock (with itself).  The deadlock is typically broken
 * after a bus timeout eventually happens.
