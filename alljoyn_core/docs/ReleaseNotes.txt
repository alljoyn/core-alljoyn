Known Issues
------------

About feature not yet supported on platforms other than Linux and Android.

support the new object based security APIs.

Compatibility
-------------

Applications written for AllJoyn 1.X will need to be modified and rebuilt for
use with AllJoyn 2.0 and later.

The AllJoyn wire protocol related to encryption and authentication has changed
in the 2.1.0 release. AllJoyn interfaces that use security will not
inter-operate with devices whose AllJoyn version is less than 2.1.0.

The AllJoyn wire protocol was modified to have a 128kB maximum message size
starting with version 2.1.0. Earlier versions of AllJoyn which attempt to send
messages that are greater than 128kB will not inter-operate with versions
greater than or equal to 2.1.0.

Starting with version 2.2.0, AllJoyn clients on Android must obtain the manifest
permissions needed to access wifi and Bluetooth in order to reach external
AllJoyn nodes. These permissions are INTERNET, CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE,
BLUETOOTH and BLUETOOTH_ADMIN.

Starting with version 2.2.0 BusAttachment::Stop(bool) and
BusAttachment::WaitStop() were changed to BusAttachment::Stop() and
BusAttachment::Join() to be more consistent with the internal threading model of
AllJoyn (ALLJOYN-803).

Starting with version 2.5.0, AllJoyn control related callbacks such as
BusListener::FoundAdvertisedName cannot make AllJoyn remote procedure calls or
any type of blocking call without first enabling concurrent callbacks via the
new BusAttachment.EnableConcurrentCallbacks() API.

Version 3.0.0 shipped with an issue (ALLJOYN-1423) that prevented earlier versions
of AllJoyn from seeing multicast advertisements produced by 3.0.0 based
applications. This issue was addressed in version 3.0.1.

Version 3.3.0 is the first version of the AllJoyn daemon that is compatible with
AllJoyn thin client usage. Older daemons cannot be used with AllJoyn thin-clients.

Starting with version 3.3.0, the AllJoyn Java binding call
BusAttachement.registerSignalHandler() no longer implicitly adds a match rule
that allows all globally broadcast signals of the given interface to be received.
Beginning with version 3.3.0 of the Java binding, the application developer is
responsible for explicitly calling BusAttachment.AddMatch with a rule that
matches the globally broadcast signals that the app wishes to receive.

Starting with version 3.4.0 the AllJoyn daemon and sample programs use a common
shared library called liballjoyn.so on Linux and OpenWrt. In order to run these
programs, you will need to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to
include the directory where liballjoyn.so is located.

Version 3.4 of the AllJoyn ICE transport changed the hostname for the Rendezvous
server from rdvz.alljoyn.org to connect.alljoyn.org. As a result, pre-3.4 versions
of AllJoyn cannot discover or connect using the ICE transport.
