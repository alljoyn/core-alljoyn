Issues Addressed in Version 14.02.00
------------------------------------

AJCORE-221: Added DISCONN and DISCONN_RESP messages as a part of the SLAP
protocol.

AJCORE-283: Enable the ipv4 loopback interface for the name service.

AJCORE-300: Check that our advertised IPv4 address is correct before sending out
advertisement.

AJCORE-339: AuthJoin endpoints in addition to Joining them, to fix the crash
that occurs if the endpoint exits before the auth thread has been joined.

AJCORE-701: ProxyBusObject MethodCall() timeout is not honored in C++ on darwin.

AJCORE-702: Remove default support for rendezvous server.

AJCORE-712: XML parser should allow singles quotes around attributes.

AJCORE-720: XmlElement constructor does not properly add children to parent
element.

AJCORE-733: Avoid propagating names over sessions created for SLS.

AJCORE-740: Change order of StartStream and RegisterEndpoint to fix
deadlock.

AJCORE-762: Fix assert failure in IODispatch for ctxt->type.

AJCORE-780: Added a new BusAttachment constructor to Java that allows the
programmer to specify the maximum number of concurrent methods and signal
handlers.

AJCORE-783: Fix deadlock in NullTransport::Disconnect

AJCORE-788: Fix IpNameService to not ignore packets from other higher capable
NS.

AJCORE-802: Add AJNPasswordManager.h/.mm reference to all .xcodeproj files.

AJCORE-806: Update AndroidManifest.xml files to specify minSdkVersion of
Gingerbread.

AJCORE-807: Ignore lower version Who-HAS packet if it is known that the remote
router supports higher version.

AJCORE-809: Endpoint is not cleaned up if the auth thread is stopped before it
enters the Run() function.

AJCORE-817: SendLostAdvertisedName must not be called with the NameTable
lock.lock.

AJCORE-820: JoinSession fails in stress mode because the SessionHost endpoint
was not found.

AJCORE-824: Don't advertise over interfaces we're not listening on.

AJCORE-847: Timer controller thread must create a worker thread only after
grabbing the re-entrancy lock.

AJCORE-859: Compute netmask for IPv4 interfaces on darwin correctly.

AJCORE-872: Fix crash when pointing to freed data in NameTable::AddAlias.


Known Issues
------------

ALLJOYN-1967: AllJoyn router cannot (quickly) detect disconnection of non-local
client connection such as thin-client connection

ALLJOYN-2192: AllJoyn thin client does not support header compression

ALLJOYN-2374: AllJoyn thin client binding cannot send/receive messages larger
than 55KB

ALLJOYN-2504: Calling GetPeerGUID from RequestCredentialsAsync callback may
cause deadlock when AllJoyn is built with OpenSSL without multi-thread support

AJCORE-271: Infrequent crash when running thread stress test on OpenWRT.

AJCORE-920: The About library liballjoyn_about.a present in the iOS/OS X SDK
is not used by the About service Objective C framework. It builds the About
service libraries using an xcode file of its own. As a result, the About
service library liballjoyn_about.a present in the core SDK would not get used
for someone trying to use About service on iOS. They would need to build it
using the source provided in the SDK using the About service workspace or
project. The liballjoyn_about.a provided would however be useful for someone
trying to use About on OS X using C++

Compatibility
-------------

Applications written for AllJoyn 1.X will need to be modified and rebuilt for
use with AllJoyn 2.0 and later.

The AllJoyn wire protocol related to encryption and authentication has changed
in the 2.1.0 release. AllJoyn interfaces that use security will not
inter-operate with devices whose AllJoyn version is less than 2.1.0.

The AllJoyn wire protocol was modified to have a 128kB maximum message size
starting with version 2.1.0. Earlier versions of AllJoyn which attempt to send
messages that are greater than 128kB will not inter-operate with versions
greater than or equal to 2.1.0.

Starting with version 2.2.0, AllJoyn clients on Android must obtain the manifest
permissions needed to access wifi and Bluetooth in order to reach external
AllJoyn nodes. These permissions are INTERNET, CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE,
BLUETOOTH and BLUETOOTH_ADMIN.

Starting with version 2.2.0 BusAttachment::Stop(bool) and
BusAttachment::WaitStop() were changed to BusAttachment::Stop() and
BusAttachment::Join() to be more consistent with the internal threading model of
AllJoyn (ALLJOYN-803).

Starting with version 2.5.0, AllJoyn control related callbacks such as
BusListener::FoundAdvertisedName cannot make AllJoyn remote procedure calls or
any type of blocking call without first enabling concurrent callbacks via the
new BusAttachment.EnableConcurrentCallbacks() API.

Version 3.0.0 shipped with an issue (ALLJOYN-1423) that prevented earlier versions
of AllJoyn from seeing multicast advertisements produced by 3.0.0 based
applications. This issue was addressed in version 3.0.1.

Version 3.3.0 is the first version of the AllJoyn daemon that is compatible with
AllJoyn thin client usage. Older daemons cannot be used with AllJoyn thin-clients.

Starting with version 3.3.0, the AllJoyn Java binding call
BusAttachement.registerSignalHandler() no longer implicitly adds a match rule
that allows all globally broadcast signals of the given interface to be received.
Beginning with version 3.3.0 of the Java binding, the application developer is
responsible for explicitly calling BusAttachment.AddMatch with a rule that
matches the globally broadcast signals that the app wishes to receive.

Starting with version 3.4.0 the AllJoyn daemon and sample programs use a common
shared library called liballjoyn.so on Linux and OpenWrt. In order to run these
programs, you will need to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to
include the directory where liballjoyn.so is located.

Version 3.4 of the AllJoyn ICE transport changed the hostname for the Rendezvous
server from rdvz.alljoyn.org to connect.alljoyn.org. As a result, pre-3.4 versions
of AllJoyn cannot discover or connect using the ICE transport.

Version 14.02.00 renamed libajdaemon.a and BundledDaemon.o to libajrouter.a and
BundledRouter.o to match the AllJoyn terminology of leaf and router nodes.
