NEW METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.CreateInterface(const char* name,
                                   InterfaceDescription*& iface,
                                   InterfaceSecurityPolicy secPolicy);
     Create an interface description with a given name.

     Typically, interfaces that are implemented by BusObjects are created here.
     Interfaces that are implemented by remote objects are added automatically by
     the bus if they are not already present via
     ajn::ProxyBusObject.IntrospectRemoteObject().

     Because interfaces are added both explicitly (via this method) and
     implicitly (via ajn::ProxyBusObject.IntrospectRemoteObject), there is the
     possibility that creating an interface here will fail because the interface
     already exists. If this happens, the ER_BUS_IFACE_ALREADY_EXISTS will be
     returned and NULL will be returned in the iface [OUT] parameter.

     Interfaces created with this method need to be activated using
     ajn::InterfaceDescription.Activate() once all of the methods, signals,
     etc have been added to the interface. The interface will be unaccessible
     (via ajn::BusAttachment.GetInterfaces() or ajn::BusAttachment.GetInterface())
     until it is activated.

     [param] name - The requested interface name.
     [param] iface [out]
          - Interface description
          - NULL if cannot be created.
     [param] secPolicy - The security policy for this interface

NEW METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.Disconnect()
    Disconnect the BusAttachment from the remote bus.

CHANGED METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.RegisterBusObject(BusObject& obj, bool secure = false)
    Register a BusObject

    [param] obj - BusObject to register.
    [param] secure - true if authentication is required to access this object.

NEW METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.RemoveSessionMember(SessionId sessionId,
                                       qcc::String memberName)
    Remove a member from an existing multipoint session.
    This function may be called by the binder of the session to forcefully
    remove a member from a session.

    This method is a shortcut/helper that issues an
    org.alljoyn.Bus.RemoveSessionMember method call to the local daemon and
    interprets the response.

    [param] sessionId - Session id.
    [param] memberName - Member to remove.

NEW METHOD
ajn::BusObject.IsSecure()
    Indicates if this object is secure.

NEW ENUM
InterfaceSecurityPolicy
    The interface security policy can be inherit, required, or off. If security
    is required on an interface, methods on that interface can only be called by
    an authenticated peer and signals emitted from that interfaces can only be
    received by an authenticated peer. If security is not specified for an
    interface the interface inherits the security of the objects that implement
    it.  If security is not applicable to an interface authentication is never
    required even when the implemented by a secure object. For example, security
    does not apply to the Introspection interface otherwise secure objects would
    not be introspectable.

NEW METHOD
ajn::InterfaceDescription.GetSecurityPolicy()
    Get the security policy that applies to this interface.

NEW CONSTRUCTOR
ajn::InterfaceDescription(const char* name, InterfaceSecurityPolicy secPolicy)
    Construct an interface with no methods or properties
    This constructor cannot be used by any class other than the factory class
    (Bus).

CHANGED CONSTRUCTOR
ajn::ProxyBusObject(BusAttachment& bus, const char* service, const char* path,
                    SessionId sessionId, bool secure = false)
    Create an empty proxy object that refers to an object at given remote
    service name. Note that the created proxy object does not contain
    information about the interfaces that the actual remote object implements
    with the exception that org.freedesktop.DBus.Peer interface is special-cased
    (per the DBus spec) and can always be called on any object. Nor does it
    contain information about the child objects that the actual remote object
    might contain. The security mode can be specified if known or can be derived
    from the XML description.

    To fill in this object with the interfaces and child object names that the
    actual remote object describes in its introspection data, call
    ajn::ProxyBusObject.IntrospectRemoteObject() or
    ajn::ProxyBusObject.IntrospectRemoteObjectAsync().

    [param] bus - The bus.
    [param] service - The remote service name (well-known or unique).
    [param] path - The absolute (non-relative) object path for the remote object.
    [param] sessionId - The session id the be used for communicating with remote
                        object.
    [param] secure - The security mode for the remote object.

NEW METHOD
ajn::ProxyBusObject.IsSecure()
    Indicates if the remote object for this proxy bus object is secure.

NEW ENUM
ajn::SessionListener.SessionLostReason
    Reason for the session being lost

NEW LISTENER
ajn::SessionListener.SessionLost(SessionId sessionId, SessionLostReason reason)
    Called by the bus when an existing session becomes disconnected.
    [param] sessionId - Id of session that was lost.
    [param] reason - The reason for the session being lost

DEPRECATED LISTENER
ajn::SessionListener.SessionLost(SessionId sessionId)
    Called by the bus when an existing session becomes disconnected.
    [param] sessionId - Id of session that was lost.

    SetCredentials if it expects to be able to communicate to/from thin clients.
    The bundled daemon will start advertising the name as soon as it is started 
    and MUST have the credentials set to be able to authenticate any thin 
    clients that may try to use the bundled daemon to communicate with the app.

NEW METHOD

    of the string is not quite as unique as the version that returns 32 hex
    characters, but it is sufficient since the returned string is identical to
    the base portion of the unique name.  Also, the returned string may begin
    with a digit and so the application would need to accomodate that if used
    immediately after a "." in a d-bus compliant bus name.

                  bool allowRemoteMessages = false, 
                  uint32_t concurrency = 4)
    Added ability to specify concurrency when creating a new BusAttachment.

NEW METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.GetConcurrency()
    Get the concurrent method and signal handler limit.
    
NEW METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.GetConnectSpec()
    Get the connect spec used by the BusAttachment

NEW METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.EnableConcurrentCallbacks()
    Allow the currently executing method/signal handler to enable concurrent 
    callbacks during the scope of the handler's execution.

NEW METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.UnregisterKeyStoreListener()
    Set a key store listener to listen for key store load and store requests.
    This overrides the internal key store listener.


NEW METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.SetLinkTimeoutAsync(SessionId sessionid,
                                       uint32_t linkTimeout,

                                       void* context = NULL)
    Set the link timeout for a session.

    Link timeout is the maximum number of seconds that an unresponsive 
    daemon-to-daemon connection will be monitored before declaring the session 
    lost (via SessionLost callback). Link timeout defaults to 0 which indicates 
    that AllJoyn link monitoring is disabled.

    Each transport type defines a lower bound on link timeout to avoid defeating 
    transport specific power management algorithms.

    This call executes asynchronously. When the JoinSession response is received, 
    the callback will be called.
    [param] sessionid     Id of session whose link timeout will be modified.
    [param] linkTimeout   Max number of seconds that a link can be unresponsive 
                          before being declared lost. 0 indicates that AllJoyn 
                          link monitoring will be disabled. On return, this value 
                          will be the resulting (possibly upward) adjusted 
                          linkTimeout value that acceptable to the underlying 
                          transport.
    [param]  callback     Called when SetLinkTimeout response is received.
    [param]  context      User defined context which will be passed as-is to callback.

ajn::ProxyBusObject.GetManagedChildren(void* children = NULL, size_t numChildren = 0)
    Returns an array of _ProxyBusObjects for the children of this ProxyBusObject.
    Unlike the unmanaged version of GetChildren, it is expected the caller will call
    delete on each _ProxyBusObject in the array returned.
    [param] children    - A pointer to a _ProxyBusObject array to receive the children. Can be NULL in
                          which case no children are returned and the return value gives the number
                          of children available.

NEW ALLJOYN METHOOD
Interface: org.alljoyn.Bus
Method: SetLinkTimeout(uint32_t sessionId, uint32_t linkTimeout)
    Input params:
    sessionId   - Id of session whose link timeout will be modified.
 
    linkTimeout - Max number of seconds that a link can be unresponsive before being
                  declared lost. 0 indicates that AllJoyn link monitoring will be disabled.

    Output params:              
    disposition      - One of the ALLJOYN_SETLINKTMEOUT_* dispositions listed below
    replyLinkTimeout - On successful disposition, this value will contain the resulting
                                   (possibly upward) adjusted linkTimeout value that is acceptable
                                   to the underlying transport.

NEW METHOD
ajn::AuthListener.SetExpiration(uint32_t expiration)
    Sets an expiration time in seconds relative to the current time for the credentials. This value is optional and
    can be set on any response to a credentials request. After the specified expiration time has elapsed any secret
    keys based on the provided credentials are invalidated and a new authentication exchange will be required. If an
    expiration is not set the default expiration time for the requested authentication mechanism is used.
    
    [param] expiration - The expiration time in seconds.

NEW METHOD
ajn::AuthListener.GetExpiration()
    Get the expiration time in seconds if it is set.

NEW METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.Stop()
    Stop the message bus.
    
    Ask the threading subsystem in the bus attachment to begin the
    process of ending the execution of its threads.
    
    The Stop() method call on a bus attachment should be thought of as
    mapping to a threading package stop function.  It asks the BusAttachment
    to begin shutting down its various threads of execution, but does not
    wait for any threads to exit.
    
    A call to Stop() is implied as one of the first steps in the destruction
    of a bus attachment.
    
    [warning] There is no guarantee that a listener callback may begin executing
    after a call to Stop().  To achieve that effect, the Stop() must be followed
    by a Join().
    
    [see] ajn::BusAttachment.Start()
    [see] ajn::BusAttachment.Join()

REMOVED METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.Stop(bool blockUntilStopped = true)
    Stop the message bus.
    
    [param] blockUntilStopped - Block the caller until the bus is stopped

NEW METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.Join()
    Wait for all of the threads spawned by the bus attachment to be
    completely exited.
    
    A call to the Join() method should be thought of as mapping to a
    threading package join function call.  It blocks and waits until all of
    the threads in the BusAttachment have, in fact, exited their Run functions,
    gone through the stopping state and have returned their status.  When
    the Join() method returns, one may be assured that no threads are running
    in the bus attachment, and therefore there will be no callbacks in
    progress and no further callbacks will ever come out of the instance of a
    bus attachment on which Join() was called.
    
    A call to Join() is implied as one of the first steps in the destruction
    of a bus attachment.  Thus, when a bus attachment is destroyed, it is
    guaranteed that before it completes its destruction process, there will be
    no callbacks in process.
    
    [warning] If Join() is called without a previous Stop() it will result in
              blocking "forever."
    
    [see] Start()
    [see] Stop()

REMOVED METHOD 
ajn::BusAttachment.WaitStop()
    Wait for the message bus to be stopped. This method blocks the calling thread until another thread
    calls the Stop() method. Return immediately if the message bus has not been started.
    
CHANGED METHOD

    Get the unique name of this BusAttachment.

NEW METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.SetKeyExpiration(const qcc::String& guid, uint32_t timeout)
    Set the expiration time on keys associated with a specific remote peer as identified by its
    peer GUID. The peer GUID associated with a bus name can be obtained by calling GetPeerGUID().
    If the timeout is 0 this is equivalent to calling ClearKeys().
    
    [param] guid    - The GUID of a remote authenticated peer.
    [param] timeout - The time in seconds relative to the current time to expire the keys.

NEW METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.GetKeyExpiration(const qcc::String& guid, uint32_t& timeout)
    Get the expiration time on keys associated with a specific authenticated remote peer as
    identified by its peer GUID. The peer GUID associated with a bus name can be obtained by
    calling GetPeerGUID().
    
    [param] guid    - The GUID of a remote authenticated peer.
    [param] timeout - The time in seconds relative to the current time when the keys will expire.

NEW METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.SetLinkTimeout(SessionId sessionid, uint32_t& linkTimeout)
    Set the link timeout for a session.
    
    Link timeout is the maximum number of seconds that an unresponsive daemon-to-daemon connection
    will be monitored before declaring the session lost (via SessionLost callback). Link timeout
    defaults to 0 which indicates that AllJoyn link monitoring is disabled.
    
    Each transport type defines a lower bound on link timeout to avoid defeating transport
    specific power management algorithms.
    
    [param] sessionid    - Id of session whose link timeout will be modified.
    [param] linkTimeout  - [IN/OUT] Max number of seconds that a link can be unresponsive before being
                           declared lost. 0 indicates that AllJoyn link monitoring will be disabled. On
                           return, this value will be the resulting (possibly upward) adjusted linkTimeout
                           value that acceptable to the underlying transport.

NEW METHOD
ajn::ProxyBusObject.SecureConnectionAsync(bool forceAuth = false)
    Asynchronously secure the connection to the remote peer for this proxy object. Peer-to-peer
    connections can only be secured if EnablePeerSecurity() was previously called on the bus
    attachment for this proxy object. If the peer-to-peer connection is already secure this
    function does nothing. Note that peer-to-peer connections are automatically secured when a
    method call or signal requiring encryption is sent or received.
    
    Notification of success or failure is via the AuthListener passed to EnablePeerSecurity().
    
    [param] forceAuth - If true, forces an re-authentication even if the peer connection is already
                        authenticated.

    Create a copy of managed object T.
    
    If isDeep is true
    Create a deep (clone) copy of a managed object.
    A ManagedObject created using this constructor copies the underlying T
    object and wraps it in a new ManagedObject with 1 reference.
    
    if isDeep is false
    Do not make a deep copy of the managed object instead make a new reference
    to the existing object and increment the reference counter by +1.
